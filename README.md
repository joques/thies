This repo contains brainstorming information about an intelligent waste management system. The project uses several technologies, including **Internet of Things** (IoT), **robotics**  and **artificial intelligence** (AI). We aim to build a multi-agent system to sort recyclable waste. One of the scenarios we intend to develop is as follows. Consider a multi-storey building, where __collector__ agents are deployed to periodically help collect and assemble waste at each floor. We aggregate the refuse in a central place, use a computer vision tool to detect recyclable objects and then complete the sorting using __robotic arms__ and __intelligent bins__.
